   <p>1️⃣ Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the solar system! 🌞🪐</p>

<p>2️⃣ Jupiter is so massive that it’s **2.5 times the mass of all the other planets combined!** 😲🌍</p>

<p>3️⃣ Jupiter’s diameter is **about 143,000 km**, which means you could fit **11 Earths across its width!** 🌎➡️🪐</p>

<p>4️⃣ A day on Jupiter is the shortest in the solar system, lasting only **9 hours and 55 minutes!** ⏳⚡</p>

<p>5️⃣ A year on Jupiter takes **12 Earth years** because of its massive orbit around the Sun! 📆☀️</p>

<p>6️⃣ Jupiter’s atmosphere is mostly **hydrogen and helium**, making it a **gas giant** with no solid surface! ☁️💨</p>

<p>7️⃣ The Great Red Spot on Jupiter is a massive storm that has been raging for **over 350 years** and is **twice the size of Earth!** 🌪️🛸</p>

<p>8️⃣ Jupiter has at least **95 moons**, including four giant ones: **Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto!** 🌕🌑</p>

<p>9️⃣ Ganymede, one of Jupiter’s moons, is the **largest moon in the solar system**—even bigger than Mercury! 🌍🛰️</p>

<p>🔟 Europa, another moon of Jupiter, has an **underground ocean** that might contain **alien life!** 🌊👽</p>

<p>1️⃣1️⃣ Jupiter has **the strongest magnetic field** of any planet in the solar system—14 times stronger than Earth's! 🧲⚡</p>

<p>1️⃣2️⃣ Jupiter’s gravity is so strong that if you weighed **100 kg on Earth**, you’d weigh **240 kg on Jupiter!** ⚖️🔄</p>

<p>1️⃣3️⃣ The planet’s thick clouds are made of **ammonia and water**, giving it its swirling appearance! ☁️🌪️</p>

<p>1️⃣4️⃣ Jupiter has faint **rings**, but they are much smaller and harder to see than Saturn’s! 💍👀</p>

<p>1️⃣5️⃣ Jupiter's powerful radiation belts could **kill a human in minutes** without proper protection! ☢️⚠️</p>

<p>1️⃣6️⃣ The Galileo spacecraft took the first close-up images of Jupiter in 1995! 📸🚀</p>

<p>1️⃣7️⃣ Jupiter's gravity protects Earth by pulling in **asteroids and comets** that could otherwise hit us! 🌍🛡️</p>

<p>1️⃣8️⃣ The planet is so bright that it can be seen **with the naked eye** from Earth! 🔭👀</p>

<p>1️⃣9️⃣ Jupiter’s winds can reach speeds of **600 km/h (370 mph)**, much faster than any hurricane on Earth! 🌪️💨</p>

<p>2️⃣0️⃣ Scientists believe that if Jupiter had grown bigger, it **could have become a star!** 🌞💥</p>

<p>2️⃣1️⃣ Io, one of Jupiter’s moons, is the **most volcanically active body in the solar system!** 🌋🔥</p>

<p>2️⃣2️⃣ A spacecraft would take about **13 months to reach Jupiter from Earth!** 🚀⏳</p>

<p>2️⃣3️⃣ Jupiter emits more heat than it receives from the Sun because of **internal processes deep in its core!** 🔥🌡️</p>

<p>2️⃣4️⃣ Scientists believe Jupiter has a **solid core** surrounded by metallic hydrogen! 🏔️🧪</p>

<p>2️⃣5️⃣ If you could stand inside Jupiter’s atmosphere, the pressure would **crush you instantly!** 😵💀</p>

<p>2️⃣6️⃣ NASA's Juno spacecraft is currently studying Jupiter, helping us unlock its mysteries! 🛰️🔍</p>
