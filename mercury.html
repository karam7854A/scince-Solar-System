    <p>1. Mercury’s Motion and Orbit:</p>
<p>Fastest Planet:</p> Mercury moves at an astonishing 47.87 km/s (107,082 mph), making it the fastest planet in the Solar System.
<p>Closest to the Sun:</p> Mercury’s average distance from the Sun is 57.9 million km (36 million miles).
<p>Unusual Orbit:</p> Its orbit is highly elliptical (oval-shaped), with distances ranging from 46 million km (28.6 million miles) at perihelion (closest point to the Sun) to 70 million km (43.5 million miles) at aphelion (farthest point from the Sun).
<p>Strange Day Length:</p>
One Mercury year (one full orbit around the Sun) takes 88 Earth days.
One Mercury rotation (one spin on its axis) takes 59 Earth days.
Because of its 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, one full solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days!
<p>2. Mercury’s Extreme Temperature Variations:</p>
<p>Hottest daytime temperatures:</p> 430°C (800°F) – Hot enough to melt lead.
<p>Coldest nighttime temperatures:</p> -180°C (-290°F) – Colder than Pluto’s surface!
<p>Largest temperature difference:</p> A staggering 600°C (1,100°F) variation between day and night due to the lack of a thick atmosphere.
<p>3. Mercury’s Surface Features:</p>
Mercury’s surface is covered in impact craters, cliffs, ridges, and ancient lava plains. Some of its most notable features include:

<p>Caloris Basin:</p> One of the largest impact craters in the Solar System, about 1,550 km (960 miles) in diameter.
<p>Weird Terrain:</p> Opposite the Caloris Basin is a region of jumbled, chaotic land thought to be caused by the impact’s shockwaves.
<p>Scarps (Cliffs):</p> Huge cliffs, some over 1,000 km (600 miles) long and 3 km (2 miles) high, formed as the planet cooled and shrank.
<p>Hollows:</p> Strange, bright depressions found in craters, likely caused by material vaporizing into space.
<p>Plains:</p> Large, smooth plains formed by ancient volcanic activity, similar to the Moon’s maria.
<p>4. Mercury’s Atmosphere (Exosphere):</p>
<p>Thin and temporary:</p> Mercury has a very weak atmosphere, called an exosphere, made of atoms blasted off its surface by solar wind.
<p>Composition:</p>
Oxygen (O₂)
Sodium (Na)
Hydrogen (H₂)
Helium (He)
Potassium (K)
<p>No weather or wind:</p> Because the exosphere is so thin, Mercury has no clouds, rain, or wind to shape its landscape.
<p>5. Mercury’s Magnetic Field:</p>
<p>Surprisingly Strong:</p> Mercury has a global magnetic field about 1% as strong as Earth’s, which was unexpected for such a small planet.
<p>Magnetosphere:</p> It interacts with the solar wind, creating magnetic tornadoes that funnel charged particles onto the surface.
<p>Asymmetrical Field:</p> Mercury’s magnetic field is shifted about 20% off-center, which remains a mystery to scientists.
<p>6. Mercury’s Core and Interior:</p>
<p>Large Iron Core:</p> Mercury’s core makes up about 85% of the planet’s radius, making it the largest core relative to planet size in the Solar System.
<p>Partially Molten Core:</p> Unlike the Moon, Mercury’s core is still partly liquid, which helps generate its weak magnetic field.
<p>Thin Mantle and Crust:</p>
Mantle: 600 km (373 miles) thick
Crust: 35 km (22 miles) thick (very thin compared to Earth’s crust).
<p>7. Ice on Mercury?</p>
<p>Yes, Mercury has water ice!</p>
<p>Ice is found in permanently shadowed craters at the poles.</p>
<p>Temperatures in these craters never rise above -170°C (-274°F), allowing ice to remain stable.</p>
<p>Scientists believe the ice came from comet impacts or was produced by chemical reactions on the surface.</p>
<p>8. Mercury’s Exploration Missions:</p>
<p>Past Missions:</p>
<p>Mariner 10 (1974-1975):</p>

First spacecraft to visit Mercury.
Mapped 45% of the planet’s surface.
<p>MESSENGER (2004-2015):</p>

First to orbit Mercury.
Created detailed maps and discovered water ice at the poles.
<p>Ongoing Mission:</p>
<p>BepiColombo (2018 - Present):</p>
Joint mission by ESA and JAXA.
Expected to reach Mercury in 2025 to study its surface, magnetosphere, and core.
<p>9. Fun and Strange Facts:</p>
<p>Mercury has no moons or rings.</p>
<p>It is the second densest planet, after Earth.</p>
<p>Mercury is shrinking as its core cools.</p>
<p>The Sun appears three times larger in Mercury’s sky than from Earth.</p>
<p>Because of its slow rotation and fast orbit, the Sun rises, sets, then rises again in some parts of the planet!</p>
