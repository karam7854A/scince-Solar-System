  <p>1️⃣ Uranus is the **seventh planet from the Sun** and the third-largest in the solar system! 🌞🪐</p>

<p>2️⃣ It’s often called the **“sideways planet”** because it rotates on its side at an extreme **98-degree tilt!** 🔄🌍</p>

<p>3️⃣ A year on Uranus lasts **84 Earth years**, meaning if you were born there, you’d have to wait nearly a century for your first birthday! 🎂🕰️</p>

<p>4️⃣ One day on Uranus is about **17 hours and 14 minutes long**—faster than Earth but slower than Jupiter and Saturn! ⏳⚡</p>

<p>5️⃣ Unlike other planets, Uranus spins in **the opposite direction** to most planets, a phenomenon called **retrograde rotation**! 🔄🪐</p>

<p>6️⃣ Uranus is the **coldest planet** in the solar system, with temperatures dropping to **-224°C (-371°F)!** 🥶❄️</p>

<p>7️⃣ Its atmosphere is mostly made of **hydrogen, helium, and methane**, which gives it its **blue-green color!** 💙🌌</p>

<p>8️⃣ The **methane in Uranus' atmosphere** absorbs red light and reflects blue, making it look different from Neptune! 🔵👀</p>

<p>9️⃣ Uranus has **13 faint rings**, made mostly of dark particles, making them hard to see! 💍🔭</p>

<p>🔟 The rings were only discovered in **1977**—way later than Saturn’s! 😲📆</p>

<p>1️⃣1️⃣ Uranus has **27 known moons**, and they're all named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope’s works! 📚🌑</p>

<p>1️⃣2️⃣ The biggest Uranian moons are **Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda**! 🌕🌑</p>

<p>1️⃣3️⃣ **Miranda**, one of Uranus' moons, has some of the **weirdest landscapes** in the solar system, with massive cliffs and canyons! 🏔️🛰️</p>

<p>1️⃣4️⃣ The **highest cliff in the solar system, Verona Rupes**, is on Miranda—it’s **20 km (12 miles) tall!** 😱🪂</p>

<p>1️⃣5️⃣ Uranus is the **only planet named after a Greek god** instead of a Roman one! 🏛️🔵</p>

<p>1️⃣6️⃣ Scientists think a **massive impact** knocked Uranus on its side billions of years ago! 💥🪐</p>

<p>1️⃣7️⃣ Because of its extreme tilt, Uranus has **42 years of continuous daylight and 42 years of darkness** at its poles! ☀️🌑</p>

<p>1️⃣8️⃣ If you weigh **100 kg on Earth**, you’d weigh **only 89 kg on Uranus** due to its lower gravity! ⚖️🪐</p>

<p>1️⃣9️⃣ Uranus was the **first planet discovered with a telescope** by **William Herschel in 1781**! 🔭📜</p>

<p>2️⃣0️⃣ At its farthest, Uranus is **3 billion km (1.8 billion miles) from the Sun**! 🌞🛸</p>

<p>2️⃣1️⃣ Uranus’ **magnetic field is tilted** at an odd angle, meaning its auroras appear in strange places! 🧲🌌</p>

<p>2️⃣2️⃣ Scientists think Uranus has a **rocky core surrounded by icy water, ammonia, and methane**—sometimes called an **“ice giant”**! ❄️🔬</p>

<p>2️⃣3️⃣ The **Voyager 2 spacecraft** is the only probe to visit Uranus, flying by in **1986**! 🚀🛰️</p>

<p>2️⃣4️⃣ Uranus has extreme **winds reaching up to 900 km/h (560 mph)**—faster than Earth's most powerful storms! 🌪️💨</p>

<p>2️⃣5️⃣ Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus has **no internal heat source**, making it much colder! 🥶🔥</p>

<p>2️⃣6️⃣ Uranus’ rings are **young compared to Saturn’s**, likely only **600 million years old**! 💍⏳</p>

<p>2️⃣7️⃣ Some scientists think Uranus **might smell like rotten eggs** because of the hydrogen sulfide in its atmosphere! 🤢💨</p>

<p>2️⃣8️⃣ Because of its distance, Uranus is **barely visible to the naked eye** from Earth, but you can spot it with a telescope! 🔭👀</p>

<p>2️⃣9️⃣ The **next mission to Uranus** is being planned for the 2030s, as NASA wants to explore its moons! 🚀🔍</p>

<p>3️⃣0️⃣ Uranus was almost named **“George’s Star”** after King George III, but astronomers eventually settled on Uranus! 😂👑</p>
