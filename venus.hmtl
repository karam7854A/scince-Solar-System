    <p>1. General Information:
Position in the Solar System: Third planet from the Sun.
Distance from the Sun: About 149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles).
Diameter: Approximately 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles).
Mass: 5.97 × 10²⁴ kilograms.
Day Length: 24 hours (rotation period).
Year Length: 365.25 days (revolution period).</p>
  
  <p>2. Atmosphere:
  </p><p>
Composition:
78% Nitrogen (N₂).
21% Oxygen (O₂).
1% Argon, Carbon Dioxide, and other gases.
The atmosphere protects Earth by absorbing harmful radiation and reducing the impact of meteoroids.
  </p>
<p>3. Surface and Geography:
</p>
<p>Surface Area: About 510 million square kilometers.
71% covered by water (oceans, seas, rivers).
29% land (continents, islands).
Highest Point: Mount Everest (8,848 meters above sea level).
Lowest Point: Mariana Trench (about 11,034 meters below sea level).
</p>
<p>4. Life on Earth:
</p>
Earth is the only known planet to support life.
It has diverse ecosystems, ranging from rainforests to deserts, oceans to polar ice caps.
Contains millions of species, including humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms.
  <p>
5. Structure of Earth:
  </p>
<p>Core:
Inner Core: Solid, made of iron and nickel, extremely hot (~5,000-6,000°C).
Outer Core: Liquid, responsible for Earth’s magnetic field.
Mantle: Semi-solid, rich in silicate materials, where convection currents occur.
Crust:
Thin outer layer where we live, made of tectonic plates.
  </p>
<p>6. Unique Features:
Magnetic Field: Protects Earth from solar winds.
Moon: Earth’s natural satellite, stabilizing its rotation and creating tides.
Seasons: Caused by the tilt of Earth’s axis (23.5 degrees) as it orbits the Sun.
  </p>
<p>7. Fun Facts:
  </p>
<p>Earth is about 4.54 billion years old.
The planet moves around the Sun at an average speed of 107,000 km/h (66,000 mph).
  </p>
<p>8. Magnetic Field:
  </p>
<p>Earth's Magnetic Field:
It is generated by the movement of molten iron in the outer core.
Forms a protective layer called the magnetosphere, which shields the planet from solar winds and charged particles.
Creates phenomena like the auroras (Northern and Southern Lights) when these particles interact with Earth's atmosphere.
  </p>
9. Water on Earth:
Water Coverage: About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water.
Types of Water:
Oceans: Make up about 97% of Earth's water, containing saltwater.
Freshwater: Only about 3% of Earth's water is freshwater, but most of it is locked in glaciers and polar ice caps (about 68.7%).
Rivers and Lakes: Contain just a small fraction of Earth's water (about 0.3%).
  <p>
10. Tectonic Plates and Earthquakes:
    </p>
<p>Tectonic Plates: Earth's crust is divided into several large and small plates that float on the semi-liquid mantle beneath them.
These plates move very slowly, causing earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountain ranges.
Earthquakes: Occur due to the movement of tectonic plates along faults.
The Ring of Fire is a major area in the Pacific Ocean known for frequent earthquakes and volcanoes.
  </p>
11. Earth's Layers:
  <p>
Inner Core:
Composed of solid iron and nickel.
Extremely hot, reaching temperatures similar to the Sun's surface (5,000-6,000°C).
Outer Core:
A liquid layer of iron and nickel, generating Earth's magnetic field.
Mantle:
Thick, semi-solid layer rich in silicate minerals, responsible for volcanic activity and tectonic movements.
Crust:
The thin, outermost layer of Earth where life exists. It's made up of tectonic plates.
    </p>
12. Atmosphere and Weather:
  <p>
Layers of Earth's Atmosphere:
Troposphere: Where weather happens and clouds form.
Stratosphere: Contains the ozone layer that absorbs and scatters ultraviolet solar radiation.
Mesosphere: Where most meteors burn up.
Thermosphere: Contains the ionosphere, crucial for radio communication.
Exosphere: The outermost layer where atmospheric particles escape into space.
Weather and Climate:
Earth's climate varies from tropical, temperate, polar, and arid zones.
Weather is influenced by atmospheric pressure, wind patterns, and the Earth’s rotation.
    </p>
13. Life and Biodiversity:
  <p>
Ecosystems:
Earth's ecosystems include forests, grasslands, deserts, oceans, and freshwater bodies.
They host an incredible variety of life forms, with millions of species, including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms.
Human Impact:
Human activities like deforestation, pollution, and climate change are affecting biodiversity and ecosystems.
Efforts to preserve biodiversity include wildlife reserves, conservation laws, and sustainable practices.
    </p>
14. Earth's Rotation and Orbit:
  <p>
Rotation:
Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, which causes day and night.
The axis is tilted at 23.5°, which causes seasonal variations in temperature and daylight.
Orbit:
Earth orbits the Sun in an elliptical shape, completing one orbit every 365.25 days.
The Earth's orbit, combined with its axial tilt, results in the changing seasons.
 </p>   
15. Earth and the Moon:
   </p>
The Moon:
Earth's only natural satellite, about 1/4th the size of Earth.
It has a significant effect on Earth, including influencing tides and stabilizing Earth's axial tilt.
The Moon has a synchronous rotation, meaning it always shows the same face to Earth.
  <p>
16. Earth's Age and History:
    </p>
<p>Age: Earth is about 4.54 billion years old.
History:
Early Earth was a molten mass that cooled down to form a solid crust.
Life began in the oceans, eventually spreading to land.
Major events like the formation of the atmosphere, the rise of plants, and the age of dinosaurs shaped the planet we know today.
