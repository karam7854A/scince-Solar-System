   <p>Mars – The Red Planet</p>
<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is known for its reddish appearance due to iron oxide on its surface.</p>
<p>It has the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, which stands 22 km (13.6 miles) high.</p>
<p>Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, which makes it unable to retain heat.</p>
<p>Its average surface temperature is about -63°C (-81°F), with extreme variations.</p>
<p>Mars has massive dust storms that can cover the entire planet and last for months.</p>
<p>Scientists believe Mars once had liquid water, and evidence of ancient riverbeds has been found.</p>
<p>It has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.</p>
<p>Mars is a key focus for space exploration, with rovers and orbiters searching for signs of past life.</p>
